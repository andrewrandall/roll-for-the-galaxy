# roll-for-the-galaxy

This might eventually one day grow up to be an adaption of [Roll for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/132531/roll-galaxy), a board game. For now, it's a playground for my free time. Eventually, it might be a playable game, sandbox for new development technologies.
